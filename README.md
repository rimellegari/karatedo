User Story:
This project is a landing page for a small karate-dojo that due to COVID-19 had to change its business model. Initially it had no website and many studentes stopped going due to social isolation or because they couldn'ta fford during the pandecmic

The dojo found a way to start online sessions to keep their students and athletes in shape and saw an opportunity to reach new clients. 

As time passed by some students return to practice at the dojo while newcomers and clients in risk groups can stay in shape indoors and benefit from the psychological benefits of physical excercise.

Technologies employed:
